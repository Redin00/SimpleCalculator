# SimpleCalculator
A simple calculator project written in C# using WPF (Windows Present Foundation) a .NET framework used to develop desktop GUI applications for windows, using XAML syntax and c# to make interactive actions. <br /> This was one of my first projects in c#, made approximately 5/6 months ago, when I first started experimenting with C#, and so it isn't very complete.
<br />
<br />
Project made using Visual Studio 2022, and .NET 8.0  |  VS solution file available if you want to compile the program yourself.
