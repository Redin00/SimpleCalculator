# SimpleCalculator
A simple calculator project written in C# using the WPF (Windows Present Foundation) a .NET framework used to develop desktop GUI applications for windows, using XAML syntax and c# to make interactive actions. <br /> This was one of my first project in c#, made approximately 5/6 months ago, when I first stared experimenting with C#, and so it isn't very complete.
